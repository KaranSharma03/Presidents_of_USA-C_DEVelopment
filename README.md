# Presidents_of_USA-C_DEVelopment

Presidents of USA is a console application which is built using structure arrays which prints information about the presidents
                 of the USA and swaps info and displays it again. It also prints the same information on a .txt file.
                 In this project, I have also created my own header file.
                 
This is an individual Project. Not an original Idea. This project is one of the challenge questions from my C programming training.
